### Theory

**1. Introduction to Python**
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language. It is widely used in areas like data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.

**2. What is Anaconda?**
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R, mainly built for data science and machine learning tasks.

**Advantages of Anaconda:**

* Includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and essential libraries already installed
* Makes package installation and environment management simple
* Helps prevent dependency and compatibility issues
* Useful for both beginners and experienced users
